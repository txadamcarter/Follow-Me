# Follow-Me

This is my submission for the final project in term 1 of Udacity's Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree. It is a Fully Convolutional Neural Network. It takes in images as input and trains a network to output pixel-to-pixel predictions of the identity and location of each pixel in the frame. This is referred to as Semantic Segmentation. It provides us with a way to identify what object any given pixel belongs to and also where exactly in the frame the pixel is located (along with depth data). When trained on a certain person (assuming that person has some unique set of features making them distinguishable from other people) the network will learn to recognize them in a crowd and the popular "Follow Me" function used in many drone applications can be created.
